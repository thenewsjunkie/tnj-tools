## Remove "Take" from Rundown Pages

A simple change to remove the "Take" quote that appears below the header on the Rundown detail page.

### Change

**`src/pages/RundownPage.tsx`** — Remove the conditional block that renders the take text (the orange italic line showing `Take: "..."` beneath the date).

No other files are affected.
